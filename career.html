                        <h3>PhD Opportunity: Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Modal Traffic Management</h3>
                        <p><b>Topic</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Managing traffic represent a true challenge for all traffic centres around the world, 
                            especially under an ever growing urban population living in cities. The increased traffic 
                            congestion is linked to an increased data availability from transport modes in the city, 
                            whether is regular or public transport, shared or on-demand services, electric scooters, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This PhD project aims to study and apply various Artificial Intelligence algorithms and build a smart modelling 
                            framework that would help manage traffic across all available modes in a city, under both regular and disrupted 
                            traffic conditions (incidents/public events/travel restrictions due to pandemics, etc.). This implies a combination 
                            of multidisciplinary research from computer science and transport modelling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first part of the PhD will focus on conducting an intensive state-of-art on the usage of AI techniques for managing 
                            transport across the globe, followed by the construction of a modelling framework on a real-city study. 
                            This will be alimented by the best performing machine and deep learning models to predict traffic congestion and travel patterns across 
                            all travel modes in advance. While recurrent traffic modelling back-up by AI can provide good insights on traffic patterns, 
                            incidents/public events or temporary travel restrictions are stochastic events which have unique features changing dynamically in time. 
                            The second part of this project will aim at extending the modelling framework for early anomaly detection across all transport modes which 
                            can help to release early traffic alarms to operators for taking action. The last part of the PhD will consist in consolidating 
                            results and writing up the PhD thesis. Some examples of previous works on this topic can be found in [1]-[5].  
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Funding</b></p>

                <h3>PhD opportunity: Multimodal traffic operations and control strategies of semi-connected traffic network</h3>
                <p><b>About the research topics</b></p>
                <p>
                    The  research  aims  to  develop  a  multi-resolution  traffic  operational  strategy  for  a  semi-connected  multimodal 
                    transport  network.  The  theoretical  framework  includes  adaptive  traffic  control  systems  (ATCS),  
                    cooperative adaptive  cruise  control  (CACC),  and  connected  and  autonomous  vehicles  (CAV)  technologies.  
                    The  recent advancements   in   information   and   communication   technologies   (ICT)   diffuse   the   international   
                    norm   of transportation   systems   to   pursue   environment-friendly,   person-centred   and   multi-modal   
                    systems   while maximizing safety, mobility, and road efficiency. To be specific, the norm of a smart city has newly 
                    emergedas the ultimate goal of smart systems using artificial intelligenceand connected technology. 
                    Connected technology in  transportation  systems  involvesa)  a  5-Generation  telecommunication  technology,  
                    which  enables  higher capacity, lower latency,  wider coverage  for real-time  data  processes,  and b) automated  
                    vehicles equipped  with advanced  driver  assistance  systems  (ADAS)  based  on  V2X  (vehicle-to-everything)  
                    communication.  These technologies  can  construct  connected  and  cooperative  intelligent  transport  systems  
                    (C-ITS)  in  the  era  of the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance traffic safety and efficiency in urban traffic networks.
                    Many cities around the world have been testing the connected technology in dedicated test-bed areas, 
                    but efforts are still far from a large-scale deployment and coordination at a city-scale level due to its complexity, 
                    large data sets being generated and difficulties to integratewith existing traffic control systems.
